# Seagate-Central-Utils
Instructions for compiling and installing new and updated utilities 
for the Seagate Central NAS.

Many of the instructions in this project make use of the cross
compiler as generated by the Seagate-Central-Toolchain project
at

https://github.com/bertofurth/Seagate-Central-Toolchain

Many of the tools in this project assume that the target Seagate
Central has an upgraded linux kernel as per the 
Seagate-Central-Slot-In-v5.x-Kernel
project at

https://github.com/bertofurth/Seagate-Central-Slot-In-v5.x-Kernel

See the individual directories in this project to view instructions
for each tool

## Tools that require the new kernel

* syncthing - File syncronisation tool


## Tools that do not require the new kernel
