# README-wget2.md
wget2 is the new and improved version of wget, the command line
web downloader.

https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/

The native busybox utility on the Seagate Central provides a version
of "wget" that can only download from plain http and ftp sites. The
version of "wget2" generated by this project can download files from
both http and https based webpages which is what the vast majority of
the web uses today.

This tool is extremely useful for where you need to download a file
from the web directly to the Seagate Central.

The build and installation instructions below are designed to be
read in conjunction with the main set of instructions in the
**README.md** file located in the base directory of the
Seagate-Central-Utils project. 

Refer to **README.md** for the overall guidelines and refer to the
instructions below for notes and procedures specific to "wget2".

## Build Procedure
### Source code download and extraction
This procedure was tested using wget2 v2.0.1. See the download-src-wget2.sh
script file included in this project for versions of supporting 
libraries tested.

Download the required source code archives for each component to 
the **src** subdirectory of the base working directory and extract
them. This can be done automatically for the tested versions
by running the **download-src-wget2.sh** script.

## Installation
### Optional - Create a link from "wget" to "wget2"
If you are inclined, you can create a symbolic link as follows so that 
calling "wget" will execute "wget2". If you do not create this link
then calling "wget" will invoke the crippled busybox version of wget
that is natively installed on the Seagate Central.

    ln -s wget2 /usr/local/bin/wget
    
## "wget2" basic usage
"wget2" can be used to download files as per the following example.

    wget2 https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v5.x/linux-5.15.70.tar.gz

To specify the file name of the downloaded file use the -O option as 
follows

    wget2 -O linux-source.tar.gz https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v5.x/linux-5.15.70.tar.gz
    
There are a number of online tutorials on how to use wget and wget2.
