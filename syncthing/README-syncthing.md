# README-syncthing.md
Syncthing is a modern, open source file synchronisation tool.

https://syncthing.net/

Syncthing allows for secure file syncing between a wide variety
of device types (except iPhones) and supports advanced features 
such as file versioning, connectivity through NAT, easy visibility
of recent changes and conflict management.

Syncthing only works on the Seagate Central if it is using an
upgraded Linux kernel installed as per the 
**Seagate-Central-Slot-In-v5.x-Kernel** project at

https://github.com/bertofurth/Seagate-Central-Slot-In-v5.x-Kernel

Note that the procedure for building Syncthing does NOT require
the use of the cross compilation toolkit as generated by the
**Seagate-Central-Toolchain** project. Also note that this procedure
is quite different to the other ones in this project and as such
the **README.md** file is not really relevant here. That is,
you only need to follow the instructions below to compile and
install Syncthing.

## Obtain syncthing
### Option 1 - Download syncthing binary
You can obtain a precompiled **Linux ARM** version of syncthing
from the syncthing download page at

https://syncthing.net/downloads/

The downloaded file will be a tar.gz archive that can be extracted
with the "tar -xf" command. 

The extracted folder should contain a binary file called "syncthing".
This file needs to be transferred to the Seagate Central.

### Option 2 - Cross compile syncthing
Make sure you have a recent version of "go" installed on your build 
system. This procedure was tested using "go1.16" which was the latest
available as of the time of writing.

Download and extract the latest stable version of syncthing source
code. In this example we download the latest version available as of
tiem time of writing, v1.18.2

    wget https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/releases/download/v1.18.2/syncthing-source-v1.18.2.tar.gz
    tar -xf syncthing-source-v1.18.2.tar.gz

Change into the extracted source code directory and execute the 
following command to cross compile syncthing for the arm 32 
platform

     go run build.go -goos linux -goarch arm build

A new file called "syncthing" will be built. This file needs to
be transferred to the Seagate Central.

## syncthing-init.sh
syncthing does not come with an "init" based startup script so we 
have included a custom startup script in this project called
"syncthing-init.sh" to work on the Seagate Central.

This script is setup to assume that there is a user called "syncthing"
that will be running the syncthing service. For this reason you should
create a user "syncthing" on the Seagate Central. 

If you create the "syncthing" user using the Web Management interface
then a new samba share will be created for "syncthing".

If you use the command line "adduser" tool on the Seagate Central as
follows then a user will be created but no samba share will be put in 
place.

    adduser -h /Data/syncthing -s /bin/false syncthing

Alternately edit the "syncthing-init.sh" script to specify a different
existing userID to run the service.

**Security Note** Be aware that the "synthing.sh" script will activate
the syncthing GUI on port 8384 of the Segate Central Ethernet by default.
Many people consider it best practise to disable the syncthing GUI
after is has been configured. You may need to modify the "syncthing.sh"
startup script accordingly.

## Transfer syncthing to the Seagate Central
Copy "syncthing" and "syncthing-init.sh" to the Seagate Central.

## Install syncthing on the Seagate Central
Log into the Seagate Central via ssh and issue the su command to become
the root user.

Copy the syncthing binary to the /usr/local/sbin directory and make sure
to set the appropriate file permissions.

    install -D -o root -m 755 syncthing /usr/local/sbin/syncthing

Install the syncthing-init.sh startup script

    install -o root -m 755 syncthing-init.sh /etc/init.d

Configure the script to be invoked at system startup.

    update-rc.d syncthing-init.sh defaults 72

## Start syncthing and configure a GUI password
Start syncthing by rebooting the Seagate Central or manually by issuing
the following command.

/etc/init.d/syncthing-init.sh start

Once syncthing has started for the first time, log in to the configuration 
gui webpage by browsing to port 8384 of your NAS IP address. For example

    http://192.0.2.99:8384

When you initially log in to the GUI you will be confronted with a warning
message asking you to configure a password for the GUI straight away. 

See synthing documentation for further instructions on setting up
syncthing.

## Troubleshooting
### Logs
The syncthing logs are located at /var/log/syncthing

I would suggest that since the Seagate Central is not a particularly powerful
platform that you only give syncthing "light" duties. It may be that during
and initial sync or while a large data transer is taking place the system may
be temporarily be a little overwhelmed.

Additionally I would not suggest enabling full encryption functionality
for folders with a large volume of data as this may further strain the limited
CPU resources of the unit.

### Configuration
The vast majority of Syncthing configuration is done via the web interface
gui running on port 8384, however it's possible to tweak other configuration 
by modifying the configuration xml file located by default at

    /Data/syncthing/.config/syncthing

Refer to Syncthing documentation for more details.
